            <h3><strong>What is PyData Chicago?</strong></h3>
            <h3>
                PyData Chicago is a gathering of users and developers of data analysis
                tools in Python in Chicago. The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts a
                place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best
                to apply our language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in
                the vast realm of data management, processing, analytics, and
                visualization. We're here to learn together, grow together, and
                build together.

            <h3><strong>Why do we need a PyData in Chicago?</strong></h3>
            <h3>
                Chicago is full of talented developers who are building open source
                data tools, talented data scientists who are using open source data
                tools, and people who are a mix of both. PyData Chicago not only aims
                to develop the open source community in Chicago, we are working to
                develop better programmers and better data scientists in the city
                through shared growth and development.
            </h3>
            <h3><strong>Do you have a Code of Conduct?</strong></h3>
            <h3>
                Yes, of course! At PyData Chicago, we value the safety and comfort of
                each of our members. We follow the <a href="http://www.numfocus.org/code-of-conduct.html">
